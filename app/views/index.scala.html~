    <h3>Welcome to the official Team Velox Rota (TVR) website!</h3>

<p>Team Velox Rota (TVR) is back for the 2017 season to fight Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with even more ambitious goals and all we need is YOU to make them a reality. The very first TVR group was established in 2005 and was formed with the purpose of participating in the <a href="http://main.nationalmssociety.org/site/TR/Bike/MAMBikeEvents?pg=entry&fr_id=28124">Cape Cod Getaway (CCG)</a>; a two-day, 150-mile charity bike ride from Boston to Provincetown. Our first team consisted of 18 people and raised $12K and was the foundation of what we have today.</p>

<p>Over the last several years we have created the standard other teams strive for including having the largest Friends and Family Cycling Team in New England to register for any MS Event, one of only three teams to raise over $1,000,000 for MS (and still climbing) and branched out from one ride to many. To date, we've participated in events with the California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, New York and Texas chapters. In 2017, we will continue our expansion by also riding with the New Jersey and Alabama Chapters. </p>
 
<p>For this season, one of our primary goals is to field a team of at least 200 cyclist at the starting line of the CCG, while another is to bring in a minimum of $200,000 to the National MS Society (NMSS). To make these dreams a reality, we need YOU, but you do not need to be a cyclist. TVR now also has teams for other endurance events to include Climb to the Top, MuckFest (obstacle course race), Jet Pull, Plane Pull, and Walk. </p>

<p>The heart and soul of TVR is our members and that core is made up of a fantastic group of social, passionate people united through common threads of fitness, helping others, and having a good time.  That makes our team a great place to meet new people and contribute to something bigger than each of us as individuals.  </p>

<p>Riding 150 miles over two days, climbing 61 flights of stairs, tackling three miles of obstacles, and pulling a 757 is not nearly as difficult as confronting a lifetime with Multiple Sclerosis, but with your help we will continue our fight against this horrible disease.  </p>

<p><em>THANK YOU</em> for accepting one of our many challenges during the 2017 season!  <em>THANK YOU</em> for donating to one of our athletes; with your generosity and every dollar raised, we are that much closer to the day when no one will ever have to hear the words, "You have MS".  </p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the team at any of our upcoming Cycling or endurance sport events in 2017, please email <a href="mailto:info&#64;veloxrota.org">info&#64;veloxrota.org</a>.  Please also see our events page for a complete list.  If there is one you plan on doing and do not see, please let us know.  </p>

<p>JUST KEEP PEDALING, CLIMBING, PULLING, & MOVING!</p>

<p>-Michael</p>
