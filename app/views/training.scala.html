  <h3>Cape Cod Getaway Training Program:</h3>

  <p>
    This basic program has been put together by Pedal Power Training to help you get ready for  your Cape Cod Getaway (CCG) experience at the end of June.   If you are participating in other bikeMS events prior to CCG it will help you achieve your ultimate goal.   This plan is a suggestion to help you get hours in on the bike, so it is ok to switch days around. If you want further training, a bike fit or more specific assistance you can reach out to Sara Bresnick at Pedal Power. <br> 
ENJOY!

  <h3>Training Intensity Levels</h3>

  <p>
    When exercising, recovery days are just as important as your full effort days.  Monitoring your intensity level is important to know when you are ready to recover, and work out next. 
  </p>

  <p>
One way to do that is to use a Perceived Exertion Scale (PES). The standard is the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion, which ranges from 0-20. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For “easy/recovery” workouts RPE level should be: 1-3 For “moderate/endurance” workouts RPE level should be: 4-6 For “hard” workouts RPE level should be: 7-9
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Level 1: Watching TV and eating potato chips</li>
    <li>Level 2: Comfortable and could maintain this pace all day long</li>
    <li>Level 3: Still comfortable, but am breathing a bit harder</li>
    <li>Level 4: Sweating a little, but feel good and can carry on a conversation effortlessly</li>
    <li>Level 5: Just above comfortable, am sweating more and can still talk easily</li>
    <li>Level 6: Can still talk, but am slightly breathless</li>
    <li>Level 7: Can still talk, but I don't really want to. I'm sweating like a pig</li>
    <li>Level 8: Can grunt in response to questions; can only keep this pace for a short time</li>
    <li>Level 9: I am probably going to die</li>
    <li>Level 10: I am dead</li>
  </ul>
